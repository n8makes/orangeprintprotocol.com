  <main>
    <p>A hybrid approach that combines the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA0Gxc2fnpA">sun, steak, and
        steel</a> lifestyle with some <a href="https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/" target="_blank">Blueprint</a>
      protocols. Live longer and enjoy life.</p>
    <p>If you are unfamiliar with either of these approaches I suggest you look into both. Knowledge of them isn’t
      required for this protocol. But both of them are producing great results.</p>
    <p>The Orangeprint is an animal-based diet with enhanced supplementation. It involves resistance training and
      mobility training. It’s about being outside, under the sun.</p>
    <p>Everyone agrees that getting good sleep is vital for optimal health. If you struggle with sleeping exercising
      will help. Glycine and L-Lysine are affordable supplements that assist in better sleep. Taking NAC when you take
      your glycine might help you give you a lifespan boost.</p>
    <p><strong>We start to lose muscle mass and bone density in our 30's and
        40's.</strong> It increases dramatically in our 50's and 60's. Eating enough protein and lifting weights
      increase our bone
      density and muscle mass at any age. It's never too late to start.</p>
    <p>Too much body fat is unhealthy and leads to many health problems. Including the number one health problem: heart
      disease. Eating enough protein is very satiating, but you still might need to cut down on some other macros to
      reduce calories and lose weight.</p>
    <p>If you aren't overweight you could still be "skinny fat". Which means you are not overweight, but still have a
      higher fat percentage than muscle mass percentage. So you are also at a high risk for metabolic disease.</p>
    <h2>Exercise</h2>
    <p>Resistance training at least two days per week.</p>
    <p>Mobility training at least two days per week. I would recommend the ATG longevity program.</p>
    <p>Sprints twice a week.</p>
    <p>And walk five days a week or daily.</p>
    <h2>Diet</h2>
    <p><strong>Do's</strong></p>
    <p>At least 100 grams of protein per day. Ideally 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight.</p>
    <p>Red meat and eggs should be on the menu daily.</p>
    <p>Blueberries, fresh or frozen.</p>
    <p>Raw honey.</p>
    <p>Olive oil, coconut oil, tallow, or butter.</p>
    <p><strong>Don’ts</strong></p>
    <p>Consume highly processed foods or drinks.</p>
    <p>Eat seed oils.</p>
    <p>Drink too much alcohol.</p>
    <p>It’s ok if you don’t hit your diet targets every day. But you should hit them at least 90% of the time.</p>
