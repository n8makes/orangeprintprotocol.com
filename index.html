    <h2>Maximize health over time. It's never too late to start!</h2>
    <p>The top three things you can do to improve your health and longevity are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Eat at least 100 grams of protein per day</li>
      <li>Full body resistence training at least twice per week</li>
      <li>Maintain a healthy body composition</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This will get you 90% of the way to supreme health. We start to lose muscle mass and bone density in our 30's and
      40's. It increases dramatically in our 50's and 60's. Eating enough protein and lifting weights increase our bone
      density and muscle mass at any age. It's never too late to start.</p>
    <p>Too much body fat is unhealthy and leads to many health problems. Including the number one health problem: heart
      disease. Eating enough protein is very satiating, but you still might need to cut down on some other macros to
      reduce calories and lose weight.</p>
    <p>If you aren't overweight you could still be "skinny fat". Which means you are not overweight, but still have a
      higher fat percentage than muscle mass percentage. So you are also at a high risk for metabloic disease.</p>
